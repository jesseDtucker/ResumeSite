							6 Years experience with C++, 3 of which were in a professional setting.
						</p>
						<p>I love working with C++, particularly C++11, as the language offers both a great deal of challenges as well as control. When I work on a project with C++ I feel like I am taking all of my tools out of the shed, whereas with other languages I feel I'm just approaching the project with a toolbox. Generally this is my prefered language for personal projects. I frequently look up blogs on interesting topics and libraries using C++ as this is a language I love to explore. Additionally I have been following the C++ standarization process quite closely over the last couple of years and can't wait to start see the C++14 and C++17 features as they roll out over the next few years.
                        </p>
						<p>
							Additionally I have experience working with pure C on Linux machines (specifically Ubuntu), Windows running with Cygwin and on an embeded system called the <a href="http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/homepage.jsp?code=PC68KCF">ColdFire</a>. Futhermore my Windows 8 projects have dealt with Microsofts C++/CX extensions.
						</p>
						<h4><u>Sample Code:</u></h4>
						<h5>Note: All of the following code is part of a work in progress Windows8 music player and is being actively worked on. Expect to see the odd TODO.</h5>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/jesseDtucker/Arcusical_snapshot/blob/master/MPEG4Parser/src/MPEG4_Parser.cpp">MPEG4Parser.cpp:</a>
							<p>
								The core class of a parser I wrote for the MPEG4 container. The parser was written to the ISO specification and handles all of the standard box types as well as several of the iTunes specific boxes. Root of project is here: <a href="https://github.com/jesseDtucker/Arcusical_snapshot/tree/master/MPEG4Parser">MPEG4 Parser</a>
							</p></li>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/jesseDtucker/Arcusical_snapshot/blob/master/MusicProvider/src/MusicProvider.cpp">MusicProvider.cpp:</a>
								<p>
									A class that is responsible for gathering songs and providing them to any external system that asks for them. Will load songs from both a local cache and from disk while also handling the cases of duplicate songs (ie. same song 2 seperate files) and songs that have multiple copies in different formats (ie. a song that has an mp3, AAC and ALAC copy).
								</p>
							</li>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/jesseDtucker/Arcusical_snapshot/blob/master/WinrtMediaEngine/src/ALACMFTDecoder.cpp">ALACMFTDecoder.cpp:</a><p>A media transform for use with Windows Media Foundation that allows for WMF to play ALAC music that is contained within an MPEG4 container. Currently functional and successfully playing a wide sample of ALAC encoded music from my library. Uses <a href="http://alac.macosforge.org/">Apples ALAC decoder</a>.</p></li>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/jesseDtucker/Utilities/blob/master/Util/include/InterfaceWrapper.hpp">InterfaceWrapper.hpp:</a>
								<p>
									A simple general purpose wrapper for objects of a similar interface. Intended for use in coercing two classes with the same interface but no common basetype into a single type that can easily be passed around.

							Working with C# is always a pleasure and it is a language I am quite familar with. Specifically it is my go to language for small projects and tools as the tools support (Visual Studio) is excellent and the language is quite easy to work with. Features like LINQ and WPF are also a major plus.

							Experience using AS3 running under both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Integrated_Runtime">Adobe Air</a> and <a href="http://gameware.autodesk.com/scaleform">Scaleform</a>. Used AS3 to build several UI components and screens with a strong focus on performance. <a href="http://gameware.autodesk.com/scaleform/tools">AMP</a> and <a href="http://www.demonsterdebugger.com/">Monster Debugger</a> were frequently used to identify memory issues and overdraw issues.

							Used Lua that was embeded in a C++ game engine that would gather data from various systems (essentially acting as the ViewModel) and the publish it to the view layer. The view layer was written in AS3 and the data usually came from various C++ systems. As such this layer would have to interact with many systems and often needed very careful debugging. Also the Lua I am experienced with was written in a somewhat OO manner as the viewmodels were not simple scripts but rather tables of functions that behaved like objects.

                            First language I learned and the one I used to most during my first couple years of University.

							Java is a language I've used off and on throughout my programming career. My most recent usage would be at EA doing some work on the Java -> C++ layer with JNI but prior to that I have built two simple Android applications as part of my University education.
						</p>
						<h4><u>Sample Code:</u></h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<a href="https://github.com/jesseDtucker/adventure.datetime/tree/master/adventure.datetime/src/ca/cmput301f13t03/adventure_datetime/view/treeView">Graph View for Android application:</a>
								<h5>Note: unlike earlier code samples this one is too spread out amoungst various classes to simply link a single file</h5>
								<p>
									This was a simple graph view solution for displaying multiple linked nodes in a story. The application allowed a user to create their own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure">Chose Your Own Adventure</a> story and then share it. The graph view provided a visual aid to see what story fragments were linked together to help a user identify dead ends or missing links.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://github.com/jesseDtucker/adventure.datetime/blob/master/adventure.datetime/src/ca/cmput301f13t03/adventure_datetime/model/StoryManager.java">StoryManager.java:</a>
								<h5>Note: I am not the only contributor to this file but I was the owner of this code.</h5>
								<p>
									The primary brain of the previously mentioned Choose Your Own Adventure Android application. This class handled providing data out to the view layer through a subscription model as well as asking the underlying systems for data. This included data that was stored locally in a database and data that was served up from a server running <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elastisearch</a>. This class would cache the data in memory to prevent database or server hits each time the data was requested.

                            Haxe, Javascript and MATLAB are other languages I've used but do not consider myself experienced enough with to say that I am proficient.
                        </p>
						<p>
							Haxe: I was exploring this language as an alternative to AS3 by using <a href="http://www.openfl.org/">OpenFL</a>. Haxe's ability to compile into several other languages such as AS3, C++, C# and javascript seems to make it quite flexible and I expect it would be fairly simple to find a means to integrate Haxe into an existing system. What interested me most was that it had better language features than AS3, in particular it was statically typed, but could easily be converted into AS3 allowing it to be compiled into a SWF. That SWF could then easily be consumed by either Adobe Air or Scaleform which means that switching to using Haxe instead of AS3 would not require much retooling work of an existing production pipeline. In the future I really want to sit down and work on a small game or other application using Haxe and either <a href="http://www.openfl.org/">OpenFL</a> or <a href="http://getflambe.com/">Flambe</a>.
