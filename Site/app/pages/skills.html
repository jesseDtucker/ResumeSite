							6 Years experience with C++, 3 of which were in a professional setting.
						</p>
						<p>I love working with C++, particularly C++11, as the language offers both a great deal of challenges as well as control. When I work on a project with C++ I feel like I am taking all of my tools out of the shed, whereas with other languages I feel I'm just approaching the project with a toolbox. Generally this is my preferred language for personal projects. I frequently look up blogs on interesting topics and libraries using C++ as this is a language I love to explore. Additionally I have been following the C++ standardization process quite closely over the last couple of years and can't wait to start see the C++14 and C++17 features as they roll out over the next few years.
						</p>
						<p>
							Additionally I have experience working with pure C on Linux machines (specifically Ubuntu), Windows running with Cygwin and on an embedded system called the <a href="http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/homepage.jsp?code=PC68KCF">ColdFire</a>. Furthermore my Windows 8 projects have dealt with Microsoft's C++/CX extensions.
						</p>
						<h4><u>Sample Code:</u></h4>
						<h5>Note: All of the following code is part of a work in progress Windows8 music player and is being actively worked on. Expect to see the odd TODO.</h5>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/jesseDtucker/Arcusical_snapshot/blob/master/MPEG4Parser/src/MPEG4_Parser.cpp">MPEG4Parser.cpp:</a>
							<p>
								The core class of a parser I wrote for the MPEG4 container. The parser was written to the ISO specification and handles all of the standard box types as well as several of the iTunes specific boxes. Root of project is here: <a href="https://github.com/jesseDtucker/Arcusical_snapshot/tree/master/MPEG4Parser">MPEG4 Parser</a>
							</p></li>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/jesseDtucker/Arcusical_snapshot/blob/master/MusicProvider/src/MusicProvider.cpp">MusicProvider.cpp:</a>
								<p>
									A class that is responsible for gathering songs and providing them to any external system that asks for them. Will load songs from both a local cache and from disk while also handling the cases of duplicate songs (ie. same song 2 separate files) and songs that have multiple copies in different formats (ie. a song that has an mp3, AAC and ALAC copy).
								</p>
							</li>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/jesseDtucker/Arcusical_snapshot/blob/master/WinrtMediaEngine/src/ALACMFTDecoder.cpp">ALACMFTDecoder.cpp:</a><p>A media transform for use with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms696274(v=vs.85).aspx">Windows Media Foundation</a> that allows for WMF to play ALAC music that is contained within an MPEG4 container. Currently functional and successfully playing a wide sample of ALAC encoded music from my library. Uses <a href="http://alac.macosforge.org/">Apples ALAC decoder</a>.</p></li>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/jesseDtucker/Utilities/blob/master/Util/include/InterfaceWrapper.hpp">InterfaceWrapper.hpp:</a>
								<p>
									A simple general purpose wrapper for objects of a similar interface. Intended for use in coercing two classes with the same interface but no common base-type into a single type that can easily be passed around.

							Working with C# is always a pleasure and it is a language I am quite familiar with. Specifically it is my go-to language for small projects and tools as Visual Studio is excellent and the language is quite easy to work with. Features like LINQ and WPF are also a major plus.

						<p>
							Used Lua that was embedded in a C++ game engine that would gather data from various systems (essentially acting as the ViewModel) and then publish it to the view layer. The view layer was written in AS3 and the data usually came from various C++ systems. As such this layer would have to interact with many systems and often needed very careful debugging. Also the Lua I am experienced with was written in a somewhat OO manner as the view-models were not simple scripts but rather tables of functions that behaved like classes.

							First language I learned about seven years ago and the one I used the most during my first couple years of University.

						<p>
							Java is a language I've used off and on throughout my programming career. My most recent usage would be at EA doing some work on the Java -> C++ with JNI but prior to that I have built two simple Android applications as part of my University education.

								<a href="https://github.com/jesseDtucker/adventure.datetime/tree/master/adventure.datetime/src/ca/cmput301f13t03/adventure_datetime/view/treeView">Graph View for Android application:</a>
								<h5>Note: unlike earlier code samples this one is too spread out amongst various classes to simply link a single file</h5>
								<p>
									This was a simple graph view solution for displaying multiple linked nodes in a story. The application allowed a user to create their own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure">Chose Your Own Adventure</a> story and then share it. The graph view provided a visual aid to see what story fragments were linked together to help a user identify dead ends or missing links.

							<li>
								<a href="https://github.com/jesseDtucker/adventure.datetime/blob/master/adventure.datetime/src/ca/cmput301f13t03/adventure_datetime/model/StoryManager.java">StoryManager.java:</a>
								<h5>Note: I am not the only contributor to this file but I was the owner of this code.</h5>
								<p>
									The primary brain of the previously mentioned Choose Your Own Adventure Android application. This class handled providing data out to the view layer through a subscription model as well as asking the underlying systems for data. This included data that was stored locally in a database and data that was served up from a server running <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elastisearch</a>. This class would cache the data in memory to prevent database or server hits each time the data was requested.

							Haxe and Javascript are other languages I've used but do not consider myself experienced enough with to say that I am proficient.
						</p>
						<p>
							<u>Haxe:</u> I was exploring this language as an alternative to AS3 by using <a href="http://www.openfl.org/">OpenFL</a>. Haxe's ability to compile into several other languages such as AS3, C++, C# and JavaScript seems to make it quite flexible and I expect it would be fairly simple to find a means to integrate Haxe into an existing system. What interested me most was that it had better language features than AS3, in particular it was statically typed, but could easily be converted into AS3 allowing it to be compiled into a SWF. That SWF could then easily be consumed by either Adobe Air or Scaleform which means that switching to using Haxe instead of AS3 would not require much retooling work of an existing production pipeline. In the future I really want to sit down and work on a small game or other application using Haxe and either <a href="http://www.openfl.org/">OpenFL</a> or <a href="http://getflambe.com/">Flambe</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							<u>Javascript:</u> General experience through Unity (unity-script) as well as hacking on simple web based projects and Node.js based tools. My knowledge is not extensive but I can work with the language without much difficulty. Someday I would like to build a web app that uses JavaScript and Node.js to expand my knowledge of the tools. In particular I want to learn more about <a href="http://asmjs.org/">asm.js</a> and how native code performance can be integrated into the web browser to provide a richer client experience. By richer I mean something comparable to a native application in terms of performance with fancy webGL rendering effects.

Additionally used the <a href="http://gameware.autodesk.com/scaleform/tools">AMP profiler</a> that comes with Scaleform to track down performance issues as well as the GFX Export tool to allow for the use of compressed textures in the UFC game (eg. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PVRTC">PVRTC</a>).

								Developed a couple of Windows 8 applications in my free time. Personally I really like the UI design of Windows 8 and I want to build some applications that take advantage of the unique interface provided.
							</p>
							<p>The first larger application I built was in C# and can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/jesseDtucker/Autonomy">Autonomy</a>. The application was an experimental test of a parallelization algorithm I thought of. However, it also utilizes Direct2D though <a href="http://sharpdx.org/">SharpDX</a>.
							</p>
							<p>
								The second application is an ongoing effort to create a music player for Windows 8. This application is written purely in C++ and utilizes Windows Media Foundation to handle the audio playback. More details can be found <a href="../pages/projects.html">here</a>.
