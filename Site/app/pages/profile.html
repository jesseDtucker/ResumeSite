							Although I may not be able to create music of my own I do love the role computers play in music; whether they are used to listen to, share or create music. Currently I am working on a music player for Windows 8.

							I believe games pose a unique mechanism for conveying ideas and thought from one person to another. Games are not held by the constraints of reality and so can pose questions or problems that people would normally not encounter. I think this can be an extrememly effective mechanism for both personal growth and as a treaching mechanism if used correctly. Not to mention games are extremely capable of capturing the imagination.

							One of my favourite aspects of software is how it can be so easily used to create something new. However, often large complex systems can interfere with the creative process. As such I enjoy thinking of ways to improve content creation workflows as they are both an optimization problem to solve as well as an enabler for creators to make something new and interesting.

							Min-Maxing is something I've learned to love thanks to games and fortunately this can carry forward to software development as well. I enjoy sitting down with a piece of code that is running poorly and picking it apart, testing theories and searching for the elusive set of solutions to make it run faster.

				            There is a special kind of pleasure found in helping other people, particularly in helping them find a means to help themselves. I find teaching is an excellent means of reaching this goal. I enjoy picking apart existing systems and then explaining how they work to other people so they can do a better job.

				Ever since I was a child I've had a passion for building and creating. When I was young it was Lego, later on it was woodworking.
				However, I ultimately settled on software as my preferred medium. I find the malleability of software makes it ideal for experimenting
				and trying out different ideas.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the past seven years I've been steadily building up my knowledge and experience through a combination of intern-ships, formal education
				and self study. In April of 2015 I'll graduate from the Software Engineering program at the University of Alberta. However, I don't view
				graduation as a point of completion but rather the first milestone. Software development isn't just about a job or a simple means to an end
				but rather a hobby and a career.
