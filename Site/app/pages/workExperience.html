						<h3>Summary</h3>
						<p>
							TODO::JT place summary here!
						</p>
						
						
						<h3>Front End</h3>
						<p>
							My primary role on the development of UFC Ultimate is developing the client's front end. Developing the user interface was an excellent challenge for me as it was the first time I had spent any signigant effort developing a GUI that was required to be both functional and visually appealing. Furthermore the challenge was compounded by a massive C++ codebase and the requirement to maintain compatibility with the Gen4 UFC title that was being devloped simultaneously.
						</p>
						<p>
							All the front end components were built using a combination of C++ (data layer), Lua (view model layer) and AS3 (view layer); the AS3 layer was running on top of Scaleform. The majority of the work was often in AS3 developing screens and widgets. Often times I was creating new widgets and screens from scatch. Typically I would start by discussing the screens design with our designer and one of the artists, after that I would sit down and work through setting up all of functional interactions including data and action hookups between the view layer and the model layer. Finally I would do an art pass on the screen by working with an image in photoshop and adjusting the screen until it matched or nearly match the source art.
						</p>
						<p>There were two major problems I encountered developing the user interface for UFC Ultimate. The first was learning to plan for design and art changes. Often times the behaviour of a screen would have to be adjusted multiple times based on user feedback. To accomadate this I often built my screens using a component model with many tunable parameters, thus making it easy to adjust layout or swap out chunks of code without breaking the existing functionality. The other major problem encountered by our team was determing how a component <u>should</u> be built. Often times getting something working was simple but making it work well with respect to both performance and maintainability was a very difficult task.
						</p>
						<h3> UI Prototypes:</h3>
						
						<p>
							Early in the development of UFC Ultimate we needed to work out just how the look and feel of our game would be designed to effectively accomadate a mobile device and a touch interface. Specifically we needed to ensure that the user expereince with the front end was intuitive and simple on a touch device. Rather than try building out a mock mobile app we instead opted to build out a desktop app and then place the app on a Surface Pro to model the touch experience. 
						</p>
						<p>
							My responsibility was to take the designs, mocks, and early art design and translate everything into the mock app. I used C# and XAML to develop the app as they were tools I was already familar with and could iterate with quite quickly. We went through three major redesigns and implementations of the app over a span of six weeks. Ultimately this proved to be an effective strategy as we identified several pain points in the early screen designs. By identifying these errors early on we were able to save time by adjusting design before we invested any signifigant art or engineering resources.
