								Strong focus on optimizing screen performance for mobile devices. Frequently used <a href="http://gameware.autodesk.com/scaleform/tools">AMP</a> and <a href="http://www.demonsterdebugger.com/">Monster Debugger</a> to profile the game, identifying overdraw, poorly performing code and memory issues.
							</li>
                            <li>
                                Onboarded several team members who were new to front end development. Ensured they understood the systems, tools and build processes and was available to provide any assistance I could.

							Developed an online store to replace previous site. The store sold very high end chocolates. Worked closely with my client to ensure that the results would meet all of their requirements. Work ranged from data entry and photography of products to web development, specifically ensuring that each product page was presented in a clear and visually appealing manner.

						  Implemented algorithm for playing the board game Quoridor. The algorithm was able to compete against a beginner or moderately skilled opponent and win frequently. Utilized a <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?UCT">UCT algorithm</a>, which is a type of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_algorithm">Monte Carlo algorithm</a>, with limited heuristics to determine which move to play. Also worked with a partner who implemented the same algorithm in C++ to compare the merits of the C++ implementation and the Java implementation.
